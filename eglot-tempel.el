;;; Commentary:

;; LSP can provide inline/template hinting for function completion,
;; Currently eglot only checks for yasnippet to enable this
;; feature.  This package patches the function or mocks yasnippet
;; (depending on what is installed) to use tempel.el for that feature
;; by translating the LSP template into a sexp used by tempel.el
